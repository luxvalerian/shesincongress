https://www.figma.com/file/CZaiNzF3XUK8xetfy22sfM/She's-In-Congress%2C-Project-1-for-GA?node-id=0%3A1

Goals:
 -- Create a field to enter user’s address
 -- Create a submit button to ‘find my district’
 -- If data includes a representative whose key values match "gender: 'F'", display representative's photo, name, title, 
 date of election and future date of election.
 -- Display representatives from both the Senate and House of Representatives.
 -- If data connected to user's address does not include a representative whose key values match "gender: 'F'", 
  - Display a message that says "Sorry, there are no female representatives from your district."

Consider:
Ajax call to Pro Publica's API.

Update:
1) When 'find my district' button is clicked
2) Retrieve address entered into form/field
3) Is there an address that correlates with the data?
  a) - If yes
  -- retrieve filtered data then go to 4)
  b) - If no, 
  -- alert message 'There are no women who represent your district.
4) Show filtered data on the page.
