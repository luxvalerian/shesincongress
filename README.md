#####She's In Congress

	Who are the women in Congress?  Is your address in a district represented by women? Women make up over half the population in the U.S., yet make up less than a quarter of the representatives in Congress.

	In this app, constituents can enter their address and find out whether their address is represented by women in Congress. If a woman represents their district, her name, photo, title and date of election and re-election will be displayed. If no women represent the district as entered by the user, a message will be displayed that says "Sorry, you do not have female representatives in your district."
